			<h1>Catalogue essay 2011 ~ Aidan Quinn</h1>

			<i>
				If you dig deep enough, all of our dreams are the same.
			</i> ~ Amos Oz

			<p>
				The figure in Nathan Ford's portrait of Mwaana (the Lugandan word for child) 
				looks penetratingly out and into the viewer. It is at once an 
				uncompromising and haunting expression largely, as is Ford's wont, 
				with one eye the emotional epicentre, framed by facial and background 
				detail in various stages of fragmentation and dissolution. It is a 
				painting that inspires silence. Mystery lurks there too, an ambiguity 
				in the harsh yet soft, knowing yet lost expression on the boy's face. 
				He is in fact an orphan, his parents victims of the Lord's Resistance 
				Army in northern Uganda, a country that Ford is familiar with having 
				travelled in central Africa over a decade ago. It is a painting not 
				without risk (there can be prurience in our presumption of victimhood) 
				especially given that the subject matter is a child. 'All memory', 
				said the poet Richard Hugo, 'resolves itself in gaze'. This
				gaze, of bewilderment, determination, resignation, embodies within it 
				something that we recognise.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There is an emotional strength 
				reminiscent of the later portraits of Rembrandt, or the tortured 
				visages of Egon Schiele. Most of all however it perhaps calls to mind 
				a more modern and iconic imagery - Steve Curry's famous photo of 'The 
				Afghan Girl', or even Don Mc Cullin's shell-shocked soldier. We feel 
				somehow that we bring to the painting some knowledge of the context of 
				this single human being's life. What we seem to recognise, or face, 
				in Mwaana is actually, to paraphrase a line of Seamus Heaney (from The 
				Human Chain), 'Me in the face and the face in me'.
			</p>
			
			<p>  
				Mwaana's is 
				a face made to be painted by Ford, it deserves the scrutiny of being 
				writ large. It is a comment on how we look as much as what we are 
				looking at; drawing us to the fulcrum of the eye, and as ever 
				balancing figuration and abstraction in such a way that what is left 
				in the painting is as important as what has been omitted. There is no 
				ostentation and no redundancy.
			</p>

			<p>
				The issue of how we look, how we see in 
				any transient instant, seems to preoccupy Nathan Ford. Take his urban 
				landscapes such as 'Last One Home' and 'The Race'. He picks up on the 
				fleeting passage of visual details we may be aware of in a trice as we 
				take in a busy street scene - the reflector light on a bicycle 
				mudguard, the strip of colour on the side of a bus or shop signage, a 
				just opened umbrella, reflections from windows in the street.
				In spite of the careering presence of the buses and vans, the towering buildings, 
				the hulking Victorian steel architecture - played out amid the lit 
				canyon-like light of modern urban life - all this too, he seems to 
				say, is periphery. It will pass.
			</p>

			<p>     
				The transitory nature of the scenes 
				depicted also carry a sense of foreboding - a white van lurks 
				menacingly in 'Last One Home' and in 'Limited Service', paintings that 
				could also be a vignette from a parent's bad dream (familiar child in 
				familiar but incongruous setting). These landscapes relate to the 
				precariousness of raising a young family, and judging by the portrait 
				of Reuben, Ford's eldest son, the father is not the only worrier in 
				the household. The apple has not fallen far from the tree.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ford has 
				recently completed long-term major renovations to his home, having 
				settled in a rural location far from the South London of his youth, or 
				his days as a scholarship student at the Byam Shaw school of art. 
				Besides the portraits of both his sons, 'La Familia' especially is a 
				painting that reflects this new period in his life, working from a 
				studio annexe at home in close proximity to his family, far from what 
				Thomas Mann called 'the guileless unrealism of youth'. There is a 
				strength, a fizz of excitement and energy in his work that has been 
				enhanced by his new-found responsibilities. Indeed Flaubert's 
				oft-quoted adage is now even more apposite to Nathan Ford's painting 
				than ever before. 'Be regular and orderly in your life like a 
				bourgeois, so that you may be violent and original in your work.' This 
				set of paintings represents Nathan Ford's most pioneering body of work 
				to date.

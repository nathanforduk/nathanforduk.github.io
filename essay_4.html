			<h1>Catalogue essay 2015 ~ Aidan Quinn</h1>

			<i>What will survive of us is love.</i>
			~ Philip Larkin

            <p>
                It is initially a slightly unnerving experience sitting for a portrait with
                Nathan Ford. With piano music softly meandering in the background, and the
                artist looking one intensely in the eye, it helped to home in on a small
                triangle of Nathan’s furrowed brow as a means of warding off wandering
                thoughts. ‘Loose!’ he repeats softly. The scrunched
                concentration is immediately recognisable from his archive of rather stern
                and unflattering self-portraits, and more than a little redolent of the
                painting of ‘Dad’ in this show. His father Stan, unused to
                an extended period of remaining still, busied himself while sitting for
                his portrait worrying about the garage he runs. The clenched look of
                concern is as familiar as the subject himself, though it is not how Ford
                senior would like himself presented. Noteworthy too is the title,
                describing the oft-painted Stan from the artist’s point of view for the
                first time.
            </p>

            <p>
                These portraits are Nathan making conversation, plotting a pathway through the
                experience of being with the sitter. He is well acquainted with his
                chosen subjects and tries to describe something of their interiority.
                Though this attempt will always to some extent be a fumbling in the dark,
                it addresses the simple question in Yeats’ poem The Man and the Echo,
                ‘What do we know but that we face one another in this place.’
            </p>

            <p>
                Nathan is nothing if not a practical artist, with a considered, strategic modus
                operandi. His tools are laid out within touching distance; palette paints
                ruler scalpel calculator rubber pencils and an array of brushes. His face
                alternates between the strain of ardent looking to the visible relaxing of
                features as he marks the canvas. All the small adult portraits in
                the show are painted thus from life, and it appears, in marked contrast to
                the paintings of his two sons that life has, to paraphrase Rembrandt,
                etched itself on to the faces with age.
            </p>

            <p>
                The portraits of his sons Reuben (8) and Joachim (6) are only a small part of
                their overall contribution to the exhibition as a whole, and their
                influence on his work in general. At one time Nathan would not paint
                his children for fear of bringing the outside world in on them. Their
                gradual involvement, from oblique portraits, through panoramic scenes of
                open spaces and vulnerability, then as graffiti draughters of monster fish
                and runaway apatosauruses, now has them as artists in their own right,
                more or less, with their own ongoing project (Grey Hope), albeit with the
                imprimatur of paternal tutelage and an ever-decreasing degree of
                choreography. One can appreciate that he wants a painting like
                ‘Carnival’ to be enjoyed in all its glory; not to give it import, but
                to show its import.
            </p>

            <p>
                It seems obvious to say that Nathan is painting his life, and that drawing
                and painting has become part and parcel of his children’s experience. On
                a visit to Rome in the autumn of 2013, he characteristically eschews the
                oft-depicted delights of the eternal city, offering us instead the
                ‘Diario’ paintings, from the rooftop of his rented apartment at the
                same time each morning. When in Rome, Ford will do exactly what he
                thinks he should and though it may seem to be a contrariness, it is with a
                hard- won confidence and single-mindedness that he carves a way through
                any painting; he has a language he can make vivid, and tools that he knows
                and trusts.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wide open urban vistas which include an unguarded child are still a part
                of the artist’s oeuvre. A tiny Joachim features in ‘Pocket’,
                enveloped by the sweeping architecture of Brighton’s Victorian
                railway station, the diminutive figure joined by an assortment of
                cartoonish accomplices. The spiders, bees and the blue elephant soften the
                sense of peril, much more present in ‘Recalculated’. It is
                Joachim again (the more boisterous of his two sons) who is nonchalantly
                strolling along the pavement in ‘Collective’, a painting which extends
                the idea of employing children’s graffiti in an urban setting.
                This collaboration, where members of the public were invited to draw on to
                the basic street scene depicted, was part of his contribution to an arts
                festival during the summer of 2014. It appears to build on
                Picasso’s remark that all children are artists - Nathan remarks on the
                reticence of adults to take up the offer to simply draw. A form of
                expression once perfectly natural becomes anathema with age. One can
                see why he would want to capture the artistic yen in his children.
                All parents do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other larger paintings depict vignettes from the artist’s life that will be
                familiar to aficionados. ‘Apart’ is an effervescent, flashing
                moment on Oxford Street as a cascade of buses slides past. The sense
                of urgency is a direct contrast to the scrupulousness of the small
                portraits. ‘Quinn II’ is a more sombre reflection, set in a semi
                rural side street near his current home. In ‘Flock’ sheep gather
                comically in a field on the artist’s running circuit. Even the bottles
                unearthed from his garden which appear in the still lifes are mainstays of
                the studio and the life he has carved out for himself and his family, many
                miles from South East London and the view of Crystal Palace so familiar to
                him from his own childhood ‘bedroom window’.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whatever the subject, a balance of figuration and abstraction is sparingly
                achieved, encouraging viewers to allow themselves the time to pick up a
                subtly woven thread into the work. The backdrops, areas that may go
                unnoticed, are what the artist sometimes works hardest on in order to make
                this happen. Large and small, the paintings thrive on their mortality.
                There is the mortality of moments; in London streets, in cavernous railway
                stations, on family holidays, the phases of childhood that are rendered
                memories all too quickly. Mortality is distilled into the emotive
                single eyes of his nearest and dearest. These small gems sparkle,
                unerringly and without flinching, in a testimony to what a small portrait
                can achieve even when, or especially when, the drawing medium has been
                reduced to its merest essentials. ‘All memory’ Richard Hugo
                says, ‘resolves itself into gaze.’

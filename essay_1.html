			<i>It’s hard being black. You ever been black? I was black once, when I was poor.</i>
			~ Larry Holmes

			<p>
				Nathan Ford’s latest collection of work 
				for the most part features close-up portraits of heads, most of these black 
				males. They are as ever, fragmented, on the edge of dissolution. What may be 
				termed the sensory features; ears, mouth, nose, hair, are in the main shrouded 
				or blocked out, giving an introverted, contemplative feel to each visage. It is 
				as if the artist is looking for something essential in the deadpan, vulnerable 
				yet often forthright expressions on these faces. Who is in there? As Francis 
				Bacon once persisted in painting the image of the nurse’s screaming mouth from 
				Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin, Ford often homes in on one eye in 
				detail-‘otherwise the world comes in and there is too much distraction’, he 
				reasons.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There is a fundamental element of 
				face-to-face communication that he is attempting to portray with this collection 
				of heads. Two feet from another human being, rather than ‘locking into’ what 
				someone may be saying, we will often home in on or get distracted with a facial 
				feature; a scar, a prominent nose, a gap in the teeth. What Ford often allows 
				to shine through in these portraits is the eye, the ‘traitor to the heart’. 
				‘Perhaps it is just shyness’, he suggests, ‘when confronted with another person, 
				another human heart that has beaten many thousands of times, blood coursing 
				through the veins, all I want to do is escape, disappear into the cocoon of my 
				studio’. It is essentially the panic of communication that he tries to put into 
				paint. ‘It is always hard to face people’, as John McGahern put it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whether during time travelling in Uganda, 
				where he was often referred to as mazungu (Swahili for white man), or, as 
				in recent years, spent living in a small former mining village in South Wales, 
				it seems that the differentiation as a black man (as opposed to, say, an artist) 
				is one that he is forced to return to, even if thinking of his identity 
				predominantly in that way is something the painter himself left behind with 
				adolescence. ‘Part of me is sick of being foreign’, he says.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the series of 
				12 head paintings (Black Male 1 to 12) Ford, again as Bacon was 
				wont to do, uses the reverse of pre-primed canvasses, preferring the textured, 
				organic ground that seems to blend with the emerging faces so well. Whether 
				they are knowing or innocent, all these faces seem shorn of self-consciousness, 
				attention sometimes averted. At other times the viewer is faced starkly, with a 
				frankness which brings to mind the last of Rembrandt’s self-portraits (1669). 
				Though all the faces are black there is a diversity of ethnicity, and clear 
				variations in skin colour. Ford has in the last couple of years adjusted the mix 
				of pigments he uses and enjoys the challenge of the subtle tonal variation of 
				the colour black itself. However it is also noteworthy (perhaps not entirely 
				without mischief) that these portraits, unlike previous, smaller series of 
				heads, but in common with many paintings in the not so distant past, are given a 
				title which makes reference to a generic racial distinction rather than a first name.
			</p>

			<p>
				Familiar also are the pencil lines on the 
				portraits, reminiscent of Giacometti’s ‘scribbled’ portraits. This comparison is 
				further accentuated in the drawings in the exhibition itself. Familiar too are 
				the lonely protagonists on the margins of fragmented cityscapes, a modern 
				melange which feels on the edge of chaos. The sense of panic is stronger in 
				Carbon Lung than Usera, both of which have their genesis in Madrid. The latter 
				has a softer feel, as if the day is warming up, a morning painting perhaps. In 
				Souk the claustrophobia, the quiet whisper of a threatening world is very much 
				there, as a child (recognisably the artist’s son) looks around fretfully towards 
				a cloaked figure in the background.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is noticeable in Souk that the 
				foreground figures have the space to be dwarfed, to be hemmed in by the market 
				trailing off behind them and the balconies and overhangs above. Ford seems in 
				possession of a confidence which belies his youth, and certainly paints with a 
				brighter palette now. This confidence is also evidenced in the Black Male 
				series, paintings with a marked and arresting individuality in paint if not in 
				name. The canvas is still obviously the battleground for this young artist, it 
				is where he pits his wits against the reality that he sees around him and for 
				the moment at least it would seem from this collection of work, it is a battle 
				that he is excelling in. As a painter I think Ford would go along with Bacon.
				‘You could say that I have no inspiration, that I only need to paint.’

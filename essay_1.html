				<p>
					Nathan Ford&rsquo;s latest collection of work 
					for the most part features close-up portraits of heads, most of these black 
					males. They are as ever, fragmented, on the edge of dissolution. What may be 
					termed the sensory features; ears, mouth, nose, hair, are in the main shrouded 
					or blocked out, giving an introverted, contemplative feel to each visage. It is 
					as if the artist is looking for something essential in the deadpan, vulnerable 
					yet often forthright expressions on these faces. Who is in there? As Francis 
					Bacon once persisted in painting the image of the nurse&rsquo;s screaming mouth from 
					Eisenstein&rsquo;s Battleship Potemkin, Ford often homes in on one eye in 
					detail- &lsquo;otherwise the world comes in and there is too much distraction&rsquo;, he 
					reasons.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					There is a fundamental element of 
					face-to-face communication that he is attempting to portray with this collection 
					of heads. Two feet from another human being, rather than &lsquo;locking into&rsquo; what 
					someone may be saying, we will often home in on or get distracted with a facial 
					feature; a scar, a prominent nose, a gap in the teeth. What Ford often allows 
					to shine through in these portraits is the eye, the &lsquo;traitor to the heart&rsquo;. 
					&lsquo;Perhaps it is just shyness&rsquo;, he suggests, &lsquo;when confronted with another person, 
					another human heart that has beaten many thousands of times, blood coursing 
					through the veins, all I want to do is escape, disappear into the cocoon of my 
					studio&rsquo;. It is essentially the panic of communication that he tries to put into 
					paint. &lsquo;It is always hard to face people&rsquo;, as John McGahern put it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Whether during time travelling in Uganda, 
					where he was often referred to as mazungu (Swahili for white man), or, as 
					in recent years, spent living in a small former mining village in South Wales, 
					it seems that the differentiation as a black man (as opposed to, say, an artist) 
					is one that he is forced to return to, even if thinking of his identity 
					predominantly in that way is something the painter himself left behind with 
					adolescence. &lsquo;Part of me is sick of being foreign&rsquo;, he says.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the series of 
					12 head paintings (Black Male 1 to 12) Ford, again as Bacon was 
					wont to do, uses the reverse of pre-primed canvasses, preferring the textured, 
					organic ground that seems to blend with the emerging faces so well. Whether 
					they are knowing or innocent, all these faces seem shorn of self-consciousness, 
					attention sometimes averted. At other times the viewer is faced starkly, with a 
					frankness which brings to mind the last of Rembrandt&rsquo;s self-portraits (1669). 
					Though all the faces are black there is a diversity of ethnicity, and clear 
					variations in skin colour. Ford has in the last couple of years adjusted the mix 
					of pigments he uses and enjoys the challenge of the subtle tonal variation of 
					the colour black itself. However it is also noteworthy (perhaps not entirely 
					without mischief) that these portraits, unlike previous, smaller series of 
					heads, but in common with many paintings in the not so distant past, are given a 
					title which makes reference to a generic racial distinction rather than a first name.
				</p>

				<p>
					Familiar also are the pencil lines on the 
					portraits, reminiscent of Giacometti&rsquo;s &lsquo;scribbled&rsquo; portraits. This comparison is 
					further accentuated in the drawings in the exhibition itself. Familiar too are 
					the lonely protagonists on the margins of fragmented cityscapes, a modern 
					melange which feels on the edge of chaos. The sense of panic is stronger in 
					Carbon Lung than Usera, both of which have their genesis in Madrid. The latter 
					has a softer feel, as if the day is warming up, a morning painting perhaps. In 
					Souk the claustrophobia, the quiet whisper of a threatening world is very much 
					there, as a child (recognisably the artist&rsquo;s son) looks around fretfully towards 
					a cloaked figure in the background.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is noticeable in Souk that the 
					foreground figures have the space to be dwarfed, to be hemmed in by the market 
					trailing off behind them and the balconies and overhangs above. Ford seems in 
					possession of a confidence which belies his youth, and certainly paints with a 
					brighter palette now. This confidence is also evidenced in the Black Male 
					series, paintings with a marked and arresting individuality in paint if not in 
					name. The canvas is still obviously the battleground for this young artist, it 
					is where he pits his wits against the reality that he sees around him and for 
					the moment at least it would seem from this collection of work, it is a battle 
					that he is excelling in. As a painter I think Ford would go along with Bacon.
					&lsquo;You could say that I have no inspiration, that I only need to paint.&rsquo;

				<p>
					The notions of family and home lie at 
					the heart of the latest collection of paintings by Nathan Ford. The work 
					can broadly be divided into 2 categories. Large sweeping street scenes, 
					barren on the margins,set the scene for off-centre hives of activity, 
					their bright flashings resembling the collisions of far-flung nebulae. In 
					the absence of medium-sized works, all the remaining paintings are 
					small, and amongst these are portraits of 3 generations of Ford's 
					immediate family. In addition is a series of still lives, which include 
					vessels unearthed from the formerly abandoned garden behind the artist's 
					home. With a growing maturity in work and in life (though still a measly 
					36 years of age) and with the support throughout of wife Anna and his 
					parents in encouraging his career as an artist, Ford has developed 
					confidence as a painter, without ever falling into any kind of comfort 
					zone. He now more than ever has the practical tools necessary (and has 
					earned the right to give himself time) to experiment with new ideas and 
					work them through fastidiously towards what many viewers would consider 
					an impressive resolution, though the artist himself remains his own 
					harshest critic.
				</p>

				<p>
					The experience of successful shows 
					has not dampened his curiosity, far from it. Echoing Picasso's 
					description of art as the elimination of the unnecessary he is paring 
					the work down more than ever, every stage of the mark-making process 
					recorded on the canvas, including the preliminary measurements. Ford has 
					the uncanny ability to draw us toward the main detail, not just through 
					his penetrating observation of streets or faces, but in the very act of 
					looking itself. Momentary vignettes are cut and pasted, reconstructed, 
					the solitary figures (so often now clearly his own children) 
					choreographed in coruscating streetscapes through which they move, as if 
					under theatre lights. The threadbare landscapes are a London we know in 
					our very marrow. Much of my time he posits, is spent on the spaces 
					that are meant to be ignored. In a way I am trying to make a subtle 
					backdrop, where I can plot a visual-neural pathway. This is of course 
					easier said than done, as the line between what is noise and what is 
					signal is not distinct. Indeed. It is in the interface of noise-signal, 
					figuration-abstraction, movement-stillness, where the fizzing tension of 
					the work finds its harmony.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ford's streets should be teeming with people, though only one (Butterfly 
					Affectation) appears significantly populated. In The North Woods (the 
					name of the area comes from a wood that once stood there), the child is 
					alone at a traffic junction, the lights, signals and sounds flashing and 
					winking in the inky blue of evening. The stance and the favourite 
					bumble-bee hat identifies his younger son, standing in a street Ford the 
					elder knew like the back of his hand. The child looks dwarfed and 
					vulnerable, though with Stan Ford's garage at the end of the street 
					behind him, I suspect this is a vicarious self-portrait, a paean to 
					vulnerability both in the child but more so in the parent, revivified as 
					when observing our children, as we ruminate on how we can best look 
					after them and keep them safe. In other paintings the children have 
					their backs to us- in The Triangle (depicting a street in Crystal 
					Palace) the vivid signs tell us it is a one-way street (pointing away 
					from us). In South Circular the little boy ambles pensively, perhaps 
					avoiding the pavement cracks, while the traffic flashes past toward a 
					distant constellation of street lights.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Boundary Wall paintings incorporate perhaps the most interesting 
					feature of the bigger paintings - the use of the drawings of Ford's two 
					children, Reuben aged 6 and Joachim 4. Artists too numerous to name have 
					attempted to capture the unfettered innocence of the child. More 
					numerous perhaps (and the writer is a signed up member) are parents who 
					stare in star-struck awe at their children's drawings. Just as the 
					street scenes seem to freeze a fragment of time and deal with the how 
					of looking, the paintings which include children's drawings are a 
					celebration of the developing mechanics of visual intelligence, as 
					Michael Ayrton put it. So here we have, in part, Ford as set-designer 
					and choreographer, his sons the draughtsmen. The children themselves are 
					the subjects of several of the small portraits, soliloquies on the 
					different moods and character traits that are the essence of each. More 
					unflinching are the portraits of the adults. 'Anna' and 'Mum' 
					particularly seem to be meditations on the harsh effects of time and 
					responsibility, though the artist himself in typical fashion saves the 
					most severe treatment for himself, perhaps in anticipation of the 
					exposure of another body of work to the world. These adult portraits are 
					moving, melancholically difficult yet irresistible, compelling one to 
					wheel around and reconsider.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ford has again produced an innovative, indefatigable collection of work. 
					The small works distil something much more than likeness, and preserve 
					this quiddity in unforgettable gem-like portraits. The larger paintings 
					manage to go one step further than simply attempting to recreate the 
					naive or the child-like. They endeavour to preserve the artist's sense 
					of fascination and wonderment at his children's unbridled, unforeseeable 
					directness, not to mention the education he has inadvertently received 
					at their hands. They nail their ideas on a blank page, in a brief 
					flurry, with phlegmatic ease. Every child is an artist said Picasso, 
					the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.
